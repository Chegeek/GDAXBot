You're free to use mycode with one caveat: give me a donation. I have two simple and free options for donations:

- Make your coinbase account with [my referral link](https://www.coinbase.com/join/593ec37501653a0135721e05).
    +  Once you buy or sell $100 of digital currency or more, you and I both will get $10 of free bitcoin.
- Send me $10 (or more) in BTC from your profits when you start making some money:
